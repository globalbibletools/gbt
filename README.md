# Global Bible Tools

## Purpose

Our goal is to build tools that make it easy for groups of people to translate Bible study resources into all the languages of the world.

## Roadmap

We are still in the very early stages. At present we are working on a tool for producing interlinear Bibles in any language. From there we have rough plans for taking what we have learned and applying it to tools for translating lexicons, and other original language tools.

In the GitHub project, you can see the [high level state of the project](https://github.com/users/arrocke/projects/1/views/5) as well as [what tasks are prioritized and in progress](https://github.com/users/arrocke/projects/1/views/1).

## Contributing

This is an ambitious project, so we need help from software engineers, ux desiginers, translators, and more. If you would like to help out with the software development please take a look at our [contributing docs](./docs/contributing.md).
