# Authentication & Authorization

## Authentication

We are using [lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) to manage authentication and session. Lucia associates keys with each user. The primary key is the user's email and hashed password. Secondary temporary keys can be added to single use tokens.

Lucia sets a cookie `auth_session` to track the users session between requests. Session data is stored in the database.

## Access Control

Access control is managed by [casl](https://casl.js.org/v6/en) policies. Casl policies contains actions and subjects, and a policy is generated for a user that describes which actions on which subjects a user has access to. Each action in the system declares the action and subject needed to perform the action.

### Actions

We define the following actions for both the web client and the api server. The policy can narrow the range of resources the action applies to.

- `create` - The user can create new resources of the subject type
- `read` - The user can read resources of the subject type
- `administer` - The user can access admin level actions on resources of the subject type.
- `translate` - This applies to the `Language` subject type only. The user can translate a language.

### Subjects

While both the api server and the web client have `Language` and `User/AuthUser` subjects, how these subjects are narrowed works differently. On the server, a prisma query can be used to narrow the access to actions on particular subjects. On the web client, the filter is limited to lists of subject IDs generated by session data.

### Policy

At present the policy is this:

- Platform Admins - can do anything except translate a language
- Language Admin - can view language translations, manage language information/members, and import glosses from the previous site
- Language Translator - can view language translations, and translate languages
- Language Member - can view language translations
- Anybody - can view language translations

### Restricting access

In the api server, access is handled by the `authorize` helper, which allows you to specify the action, subject type, and subject id. If the user does not have the correct permissions, a 403 status code will be returned.

In the web client, a different `authorize` helper can be used in a route data loader to prevent the route from loading if the user doesn't have proper permissions. Within a view, to hide or show parts of the interface based on permissions, the `useAccessControl` hook creates a function that can be used to conditionally render JSX or to pass a boolean to a component.
