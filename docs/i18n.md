# i18n

We use [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) to handle internationalization.

## Adding new languages

1. Create a new directory in `packages/web/src/public/locales/` with the locale code (ie `en`).
2. Copy the json files from another language into the new directory and update the strings for the new language.
3. Add the code the localized name of the language to `packages/web/src/app/languages.json`.

## Bible Name Translations

The data in `packages/web/src/public/locales/<locale-code>/bible.json` is used to parse and generate references in each language. There are 2 keys for each book of the Bible. For reference, here is some data from `en/bible.json` for Genesis:

```
  "gen": "Genesis",
  "gen_short": "Gen",
```

The first line is the title of the book (Genesis). The second line is the short-hand abbreviation of the book title (Gen).

The first three characters of each key in `bible.json` identify the book. See `data/book-keys.ts` for an array of all the book keys. You should use the lowercase version of each key If you copied `bible.json` from another language, you should already have all the correct keys.

The `reference_format` key at the top of the file is for formatting references and parsing references.

- `reference_format` should contain `{{bookName}}`, `{{chapterNumber}}`, and `{{verseNumber}}`, along with whatever other characters are needed to generate a human-readable reference
